Revision history for Perl extension Time::Duration::Parse

0.11 2014-03-26
    - Min perl version now set to 5.6.0
    - Added description of DateTime::Format::Duration to SEE ALSO

0.10 2014-03-24
    - Switched to Dist::Zilla. The Module::Install Makefile.PL was resulting
      in dependency problems and CPAN Testers fails, and I'm not familiar with
      it. Easier to switch. Thanks to ZEFRAM for pointing out the problem.

0.09 2014-03-23
    - Test::More and Time::Duration were listed as build_requires;
      changed them to test_requires, with versions. Wonder if this was
      the cause of the small number of CPAN Testers fails?
    - Added more more modules to the SEE ALSO section in the pod.
